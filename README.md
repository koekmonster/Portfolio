# Portfolio

This Portfolio page also contains two files calles indext.html and styles.css which contains the code for the page to
work properly and the wat it looks.
The Portfolio page consists of the Home page which has my picture and the intro saying that
I am a Web Developer and itroducing me in short.
The there is a navigation bar tab that takes you down to the About Me that talks about myself in a little bit more depth.
After that is my Projects Page that talks about my recent projects and what it consists of.
Lastly it has all my contact details and my GitHub repositories and LinkedIn profile.
